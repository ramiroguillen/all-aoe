            <p>Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings is a real-time strategy computer game set in the Middle Ages. It was
                released in 1999, and is the second main title of the Age of Empires series developed by Ensemble
                Studios
                and published by Microsoft. Due to its commercial success, an expansion pack was released; Age of
                Empires
                II: The Conquerors, followed by a Gold Edition, which bundled together the two games along with a bonus
                map
                and game matches recorded by Microsoft strategy experts. </p>
            <p>In 2013, Age of Empires II HD was announced and given a release date of April 9, 2013 on the Steam
                digital
                distribution platform for Windows operating systems only. The HD Edition includes both the original game
                and
                the expansion The Conquerors, as well as updated graphics for high-resolution displays. It also supports
                user-generated content through the Steam Workshop and multiplayer games provided through the Steam
                servers.
                After more than a decade another expansion pack was released, Age of Empires II HD: The Forgotten. It
                had
                more bug fixes, advanced AIs and balancing. It required the HD version to be installed first. Later, in
                2015, the new expansion Age of Empires II HD: The African Kingdoms was added, giving a total of 27
                civilizations. The following year in 2016, Age of Empires II HD: Rise of the Rajas was released on the
                19th
                of December, bringing the total number of civilizations to 31.</p>
