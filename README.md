# ALL AoE II

This is my final project for Coderhouse's Web Development & Design Course. It's an informative page about Age of Empires II game, where you can explore its content, like the civilizations you can choose in-game or tutorials about how to play it. There is a tournament page where you can see what tournaments are being played and streamers to see them.

It's build with HTML for structure, CSS and SASS for custom styles, and Bootstrap for templates and responsiveness.
